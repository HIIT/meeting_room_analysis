Note: this is the implementation of cocoreg algorithm in Python and it was originally in R,
the performance and behavior are not confirmed yet to be the same between both implementations. So please
refer to the original implementation in R [1] if you have any doubts. Also please refer to the original paper [2] for how it works.
